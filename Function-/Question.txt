 Q1. What is the diffrent between parameter and arguments
 Q2. Level 1: Auto-generate and fill an array of 100 integers based on the below rules.
  Each number has to be a multiple of 9 starting from 9 (9, 18, 27, 36,â€¦.)
Take the last two digits of each number. If the difference between the last two digits is  3, make the number a negative value.
  
Example:
36. The difference between 3 and 6 is 3. Hence it should be stored as -36
  63. The difference between 6 and 3 is 3. Hence it should be stored as -63.
Another example is 225. The last two digits are 2 and 5. The difference is 3.  The number should be stored as -225.
Display all the 100 such numbers. in java
Q3. How to acees the object in Function;
 
    Function 
Function is collection of the object or collection of the code
explanation : if you make a addition method i use this method so many time using or calling method name ;
these have also parameters but parameters is optionals also.
if add two number then also pass the parameters
eg. Function add (){
    return value;
}
add() // this calling the method;
according to this i call again and again 
parameter && arguments
if you create a method then passig these value is known as parameter and then if you call the method then pass these value is called arguments
